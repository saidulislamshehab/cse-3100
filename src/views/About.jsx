                <p>
                    At Purrfect Adoption, our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome cats in need.
                    We believe every cat deserves a loving family and a safe environment. Through our dedicated
                    adoption program, we match cats with families who will cherish them for life.

                <h2>Our history</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2020, Purrfect Adoption started as a small community initiative to help stray cats
                    find homes. Over the years, we've grown into a trusted organization, successfully placing hundreds
                    of cats with loving families. Our commitment to animal welfare drives everything we do.
